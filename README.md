# BFCD
A better cd tool

## Ideas
- Fuzzy finding CD
    - With idea of depth adjustable fuzzy finding
    - Has to be concious that it's searching for files, unlike fzf which operates on strings
    - preference during selection should take into account the file path
- Ability to infer the path
    - Let's say there's only one entry left in the list, automatically cd into it
- TUI interface
    - See `fzf --preview` maybe?
